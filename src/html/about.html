  <p class="text">Hi!</p>
  <p class="text">
    My name is <span class="orange">Artur</span>. My first contact with
    programming was in high school. Back then, I was creating simple console
    programs in C++. In college (I studied finance), I seriously started to
    think about a career in IT.
  </p>
  <p class="text">
    I've been learning programming for 11 months. I am currently looking for a
    job or internship as a Frontend Web developer.
